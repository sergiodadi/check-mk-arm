Checkmk for Raspberry Pi (buster 32 bits and bulleyes 64 bits)

first, thanks to https://github.com/chrisss404/check-mk-arm , we only build somes packages with the chriss404 script
We use his tool to build some packages:

- check-mk for Raspberry buster 32 bits 
- check-mk for Raspberry bulleyes 64 bits

On the release page you can find deb packages targeting the following systems:
- Raspberry Pi OS buster 32 bits
- Raspberry Pi OS bulleyes 64 bits

I have tested the package on a **Raspberry PI 4** (with 4 Gb)
